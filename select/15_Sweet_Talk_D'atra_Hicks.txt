I don't care about candy or roses
That came all wrapped up in ribbons and bows
I'm not impressed by a fool and his money
Who'll keep me wrapped up in diamonds and furs

Give me a man who knows what to say
In the heat of the night
When the moment is right
I need a lover who will whisper in my ear
And tell me all the things
That I'm longing to hear
You can keep your money by that's all right
It's the sweet talk baby that I like
You drive a fancy car and that's real nice
But it's sweet talk baby that keeps me satisfied

I'm not looking for winning and dining
Exclusive nights on the town ain't my thing
What I need it some real conversation
Don't want no ride in your black limousine

Give me a man who knows what to say
In the heat of the night
When the moment is right
I need a lover who will whisper in my ear
And tell me all the things
That I'm longing to hear
You can keep your money by that's all right
It's the sweet talk baby that I like
You drive a fancy car and that's real nice
But it's sweet talk baby that keeps me satisfied

I like it
I love it
Got to have that sweet talk
Need it day and night
Keeps me satisfied
I need it
I want it baby
Talk that talk
Cause you can't sweet talk
Then you might as well walk

Give me a man who knows what to say
In the heat of the night
When the moment is right
I need a lover who will whisper in my ear
And tell me all the things
That I'm longing to hear
You can keep your money by that's all right
It's the sweet talk baby that I like
You drive a fancy car and that's real nice
But it's sweet talk baby that keeps me satisfied
You can keep your money by that's all right
It's the sweet talk baby that I like
You drive a fancy car and that's real nice
But it's sweet talk baby that keeps me satisfied.
